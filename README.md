## Project Name
Ad Design
## About
This project is an animated advertisement designed using JavaScript and the p5.js library (via JSProcessing) for a fictional space exploration campaign inspired by SpaceX. It was created as part of a Khan Academy learning exercise to explore creative coding, animations, and visual design through programming.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system (typically via a modern web browser). No additional libraries are required beyond the p5.js library, which can be included via CDN or downloaded.
## Features
AdDesign includes these features:

-Animated visual elements including a growing rectangle explosion and scaling star/rocketship images

-Dynamic text rendering with varying sizes and colors for promotional messages

-Use of p5.js drawing functions for shapes, colors, and motion

-Responsive canvas-based rendering for dynamic advertisement display

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/AdDesign.git`
## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (ad.js) in a p5.js environment, such as the online editor at editor.p5js.org or by including p5.js in an HTML file:

1. Open index.html in a web browser, or

2. Load the ad.js sketch in the p5.js editor.
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand fundamentals of JavaScript animation and dynamic rendering

-Gain proficiency in p5.js for creative coding, including shape drawing, text styling, and image manipulation

-Apply programming concepts to create visually engaging advertisements
